    "Vectors are ordered arrays of numbers. They are denoted with lower-case bold letters such as $\\mathbf{x}$.  The elements of a vector are all the same type. A vector does not, for example, contain both characters and numbers. The number of elements in the array is often referred to as the *dimension* of the vector. The elements of a vector can be referenced with an index, where we use 0 to n-1 in computer science (Well, except for MATLAB, faik) as opposed to 1 to n for the indices in Math. In notation, elements of a vector, when referenced individually, will indicate the index in a subscript. For example, the $0^{th}$ element, of the vector $\\mathbf{x}$ is $x_0$. Note that the x is not bold in this case.\n"

The elements of a matrix are all of the same type — if I didn't say this before, I found out about this today. Anyhoo, matrices are denoted with upper-case, bold letters such as $\\mathbf{X}$. A lot of the times, `m` is often the number of rows and `n` the number of columns.
