Data mining is the process of discovering patterns in large data sets using techniques and tools like linear classifiers, clustering, dimension reduction, transductive learning and topic modeling from mathematics, computer science and statistics.

## Technologies Used

+`Python:`A high-level, versatile programming language that is widely used in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence due to its readability, simplicity, and large community support.

+`TensorFlow`: Framework for deep learning.

+`MLflow`: Manages machine learning workflows.

+`NumPy`: Supports numerical calculations.

+`Pandas`: Handles data manipulation and analysis.

+`Scikit-learn`: Machine learning algorithms and tools.

+`Keras`: User-friendly interface for building neural networks.

+`Jupyter`: an interactive computing environment, allowing users to create notebooks that integrate code, visualizations, and narrative text. I documented the process in various notebooks for ease of understanding and learning! :)
